        <p class="info">
          I have been interested in Front-end for quite some time now. My
          journey into programming started with the basics of Python on
          Codecademy, and after that, I got introduced to HTML and CSS. I fell
          completely in love with the possibility of creating something with my
          own head and hands. But very soon I understood that it is really
          difficult to navigate the whole process without getting feedback from
          professionals, and it became even more difficult when I got to
          JavaScript. When I got interested in web design, my mother-in-law
          wanted to support my passion, so she asked me to create a website for
          her flower shop. I loved working on this task, though I was a total
          beginner and it shows (you can check it out here:
          <a href="https://www.knoppochblad.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="knoppochblad">https://www.knoppochblad.se</a>).
          I really want to study this course to get better at what I
          already know and to learn new things that can help me progress in my dream
          field.

          Why do I think that I would be a good future developer?
        </h1>
        <p class="info">
          I think that I would be a good developer because I have two things
          that I think are vital for programming - <span class="marked">focus</span> and <span class="marked">passion</span>. I can
          spend the whole day debugging and trying something new thanks to my
          ability to focus. And thanks to my passion even when things don't work
          and I want to give up, something inside me immediately reminds me how
          much pleasure it brings me to create websites, even if the whole
          process challenges me. I think that front-end can become my life’s
          work - and the one thing that I need for it to become true is great
          teachers. And I am sure that I will find them at Sundsgården
          Folkhögskola.

        <h1 class="rubric">A little bit about myself</h1>
        <p class="info">
          My full name is Polina, but I prefer Polly (yes, like a parrot or
          Swedish sweets &#128513;). Originally I am from Russia, but two years ago I
          met a Swedish guy while being on covid-lockdown at a hotel in Latvia.
          We fell in love, and after staying for 6 months in Latvia, we decided
          to move to Sweden. It was a wonderful change because I adore both
          Sweden and the Swedish language. Of course, as an expat, I experienced
          a lot of ups and downs, but no amount of difficulties can take away
          the feeling that I have finally found a home.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
          My whole life I was fascinated with books and languages and not so
          long ago I got a bachelor's degree in literature and a master's degree
          in linguistics. For some time I worked as a teacher and a translator -
          and I loved it! But it has always felt that something was missing. So
          I tried out different jobs and hobbies, but nothing felt right until I
          came across programming. I was so sure that programming is for those
          who are great at math and physics, so it was difficult for me to dare
          to take my new hobby seriously. After a while it got hard to resist
          the overwhelming interest in programming - I could spend hours sitting
          in front of the computer, trying to solve a problem in Python or
          learning how to create different kinds of buttons in HTML and CSS. So
          I decided that it was time to listen to my inner self and take a
          chance on making my hobby into my future profession.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
          Besides programming, I also enjoy reading books, embroidering, doing
          yoga, drawing, and playing monopoly and cozy video games in my spare
          time.
